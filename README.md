# 📚 DailyInspire - Your daily inspiration 💡✍

**Welcome to DailyInspire!**
This project was born out of a passion for quotes read on books and listened on podcast. As a software developer my idea was to mix tech knowledge and experiments with one of my passion. 
I strongly believe in the power of a word or a phrase and I think that the right way to start the day is by getting inspired by great quotes.
